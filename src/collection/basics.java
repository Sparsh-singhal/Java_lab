package collection;

//collection is a group of objects
//to store and manipulate multiple objects collection framework is used
//array vs collections
//array works on indexes and is homogenous whereas collection like arraylist stores heterogeneous data
//before java1.2 there are multiple classes and interfaces to store and manipulate collections but they all work differently collection framework
//united them to work in the same way

//hierarchy of collection framework
// iterable(interface) -> collection(interface) -> {{list(interface)-> classes{arraylist, linked list-> arraydequeue, vector->stack}}, queue, set}
