multithreading:- each cpu can have multiple threads and processes are divided into these physical or virtual threads
multiprogramming:- multiple tasks loaded into memory running one by one if any program wait for resource
multitasking:- multiple program running processes so fast in tme slices it create illusion of parallelism
multiprocessing:- multiple cores of cpu running tasks concurrently


there are 2 ways to create threads in java:-
1) thread class
2) runnable Interface


Life cycle of thread

      start()         jvm->OS to schedule                task complete
NEW-----------→Runable-----------------------→Running--------------------→Terminate
